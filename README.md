# Tensor decomposition on gene expression
I aim to build a pipeline for utilizing the CP tensor decomposition on gene expression data  
(Now I just uploaded all code files, and they are not incorparated into a pipeline yet)

# Acknowledgement
The code of CP decomposition is exactly from [here](https://github.com/songlab-cal/MultiCluster)  
Their paper is published [here](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1560758439)
